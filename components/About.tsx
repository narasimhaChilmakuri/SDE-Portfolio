            <p>
              I am a <span className="text-zinc-200 font-medium">Software Engineer</span> driven by the challenge of building systems that scale. My background is deeply rooted in the Java ecosystem, where I've spent the last year architecting microservices and optimizing data pipelines.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Currently, I am bridging the gap between backend robustness and frontend interactivity, expanding into <span className="text-zinc-200 font-medium">Full-Stack Development</span> and <span className="text-zinc-200 font-medium">Cloud Architecture</span>. I believe software engineering is as much about communication and clean design as it is about algorithms.
